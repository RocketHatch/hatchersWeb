<h2>Building local communities globally</h2>

The Rocket Hatch Creative Community Web app

Our Open source project is now on **Heroku**<br>
**[RocketHatchers.us] (http://rockethatchers.us)**<p>

Open source project for creative communities. Looking for project team members. If you are interested in being a part of this project contact, Larry Mason @ larry.mason@alltowntech.com. 

While this project in its present state is specific to the Huntsville Metropolitan area, the larger goal of this project is to provide template source code for communities of all kinds to share the Faces, Places, Ideas and Events that make each community special. To do that we need developers. We are specifically interested in attracting developers who would like to contribute in the following areas:

* Programming APIs so this project can be apart of custom software solutions
* CSS abstraction for allowing designers to put their own design on this interface
* And Architects that can design modular components for build community Web Applications

The general philosophy, though not in much in evidence currently,is to build (and refactor towards) "simple fuctions" that work together to provide a lot of functionality -  Watch this video! ["Simple Made Easy"] (http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

This project is the brain child of [Antonio Montoya] (antoniomontoya.com) and the initial graphic design was done by Tara Anzalone of [Modern & Smart] (http://hellotarra.com/). But mostly like all project of this nature we stand on the shoulders of giants and we borrowed heavily from previos efforts spcifically in:
* [Portland OR] (http://prtlnd.com/)
* [Nashville TN] (http://nshvll.org/)
* [Omaha NE] (http://omawho.com/)
 
<h3>But most of all we look forward to working with you to help "build local community, globally!"</h3>
